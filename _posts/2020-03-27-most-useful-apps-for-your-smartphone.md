For a long time, I used my smartphone like everyone else – to do things that are anything but smart.

A smartphone is almost like a computer and there are tons of things that you can do with it.

But unfortunately, most of us do not make the best use of our smartphones. If anything, we waste time on it. Our use of smartphones is restricted to taking photos, using IM apps, like Whatsapp, to chat, social networking (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.), watching movies (Netflix and chill) and listening to music (Spotify). 

No wonder it is considered as a distraction by many. And it is true. Despite spending so much time with our smartphones, we barely have anything productive to show.

I am a Content Writer/Editor by profession. My profession demands me to be online most of the times. But it is not humanly possible to be with a laptop all the time. That’s when, I started looking for useful apps to install in my smartphone.

Over the next two years, I realized I could make every second I spend on my smartphone count.

At present, I have the following apps installed on my smartphone:

## WordPress

As a Content Writer/Editor/Blogger, this is one of the most important apps that I need. Our company blog is powered by WordPress. The Android app for WordPress is quite decent and allows you to write/edit content of your blog on the go, especially, for minor updates and stuff.

## iA Writer

A distraction-free writing app with Markdown support, this is one of my most favourite apps. The Android version is available for free. I use it for offline writing and then save the files in Dropbox.

## Dropbox

This cloud storage app allows syncing between multiple devices. So, let’s say, I am writing something from my smartphone on iA Writer, while on my way to office. I save it in my Dropbox folder. Now, when I reach office, I can simply open the Dropbox folder on my computer and access that file.

## Dynalist

This free app is one of the best apps available in Play Store for writing to-do lists and bullet journals. Of course, I can use iA Writer for the same. But I think every app has a certain purpose. Also, I do not want to keep unnecessary files in the Dropbox folder. Dynalist is a great app to keep your raw thoughts, lists, etc.

## Google Analytics

My profession demands me to keep constant track of what is happening in my blog, how are the articles performing. Also, the numbers help in better planning.

## Udemy

Having subscribed to various courses, I use this app to watch the videos when I don’t feel sitting in front of my computer. 

## Termux

It is an Android terminal emulator and Linux environment app. Basically, it provides a command line environment. Recently, I am learning how to work with servers and all. And I use it to interact with servers. 

## Dcoder

I have always loved coding ever since I was introduced to it during my days in engineering college. Although my profession doesn’t demand knowledge of coding (except basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), I still do it whenever I get time, sometimes while I am travelling. Dcoder is a mobile coding IDE that I use to practice programming on the go.

## Quora

I am very active on Quora and I get tons of requests every day. Of course, I need the Quora app on my smartphone. Also, Quora is a place where people genuinely tend to help others sharing their knowledge, thanks to Quora’s strict moderation policy.  

## Pocket

Sometimes, while reading on the go, I come across long and in-depth articles which I want to read later, giving 100% of my attention. I save these articles to read later using Pocket. This amazing app lets you save articles, videos and pages from any publication or app. Also, it acts a reference guide for later use.

## Medium

Another great place to read quality articles about everything under the sun, I love this app. Many prominent publications maintain a Medium blog. It also lets you bookmark articles to read later.

In addition to these useful apps, I also have Netflix, Amazon Prime, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter installed on my smartphone. I used to spend a lot of time on these apps. So, I had deactivated them at one point. Now, although I have these apps, I use them very rarely. Most of the times, I use the above apps. This has boosted my productivity tens of times.
