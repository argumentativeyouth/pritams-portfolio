Content Writing, especially writing blogs, is not a menial job.

It's not like you copy stuff from other websites, paste it in your WordPress Editor, rephrase things, and hit the 'Publish' button. And if that's what you do, you are not a Content Writer. You are not a blogger.

Blogging is a big responsibility.

Even if there are separate individuals/teams in your organisation to look after the technicalities and stuff like SEO, even if there are editors to review your articles, the process of just writing is no less important than any of these things.

If anything, it is the most important of all.

Because the stakeholders are many.

Writing quality blog posts requires focus and stamina to do proper research.

It requires one to put their maximum effort in order to create the most useful and relevant content.

The content that you produce must serve the very purpose that it intends to.

The importance of serious blogging can be understood if we know the stakeholders and their relationship with the content that you create.

As a blogger, you are answerable to the following three and must cater to them in every piece of article you write:

### A. The Organisation You Work For

It is your responsibility to educate your audience about the mission and vision of the organisation, and how the company and its products, if any, can help them solve their problem.

After all, there is a reason why the organisation has a blog - to provide information, help/educate the target audience, and most importantly, promote themselves.

There are two types of people who would land on the blog:

1.	People who are already aware of the organisation and what it does.
2.	People who have a problem (that your company has a solution for) and are looking for a solution online.

The former already knows what exactly your organisation has to offer. But they still might visit the blog to check what's new, what's happening now.

The latter, on the other hand, probably stumbled upon your article on Google while they were looking for a solution to a problem.

Your blog content should educate both these categories of people about how you, your company can help them.

### B. Your Audience

Now, just because blogging is done for the purpose of marketing, it doesn't mean you should resort to unethical or mindless promotion of the organisation and its offerings.

You should sound authoritative. Your content should make sense. Your readers should get a satisfactory answer/solution to what they are looking for.

And at the same time, you have to make sure that you educate them on how you, as an organisation, can help them.

That's why I believe blogging is not just mindless marketing.

Also, if your readers do not find your content useful, they won't visit again, even if you rank in number 1 position. This, in turn, will impact the SEO Ranking of the site negatively.

### C. Search Engines, Especially Google

The better the article (properly optimised, quality content providing valuable and useful information), the smarter the search engines become.

See, Google has always maintained that what matters the most is how helpful your content is and whether or not people find it useful.

The Google algorithm or algorithm of any other search engines, at this point, is not as smart and sophisticated as a human being - it doesn't really read, process, and understand the message conveyed in an article like a human, to decide whether or not the content is useful.

It picks up various signals like SEO and backlinks to determine the relevancy of an article and ranks accordingly.

But with every passing day, it is becoming smarter, thanks to Artificial Intelligence - which basically mimics "cognitive" functions associated with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving".

Like any other AI, the Google algorithm learns from what is fed to it, i.e. the content that you produce and how people take it.

Of course, at this point, you can manipulate all these things to a great extent. But cheating the very platform through which your content gets noticed wouldn't be the right thing to do - not only because it is unethical but also because sooner or later, it is going to backfire.

So, yes. As a blogger, you are answerable to these three. Ethical blogging demands you cater to all three of them.

This isn't an easy task and needs rigorous dedication and most importantly, the will to contribute towards a better future for all - your organisation, your audience, and the search engines.
