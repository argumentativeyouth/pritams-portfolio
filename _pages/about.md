![Hello](/assets/img/08.jpg)

I am a doodler, scribbler, blogger, philonoist & spy, in the reverse order.

I also love photography.

I work at an AI-powered edtech, revolutionizing education.

I am a rationally cynical & candid person in pursuit of civility.

I love watching [movies](https://pritams.blog/movies) and reading [books](https://pritams.blog/books)... and, of course, writing.

I am available on:

- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/prritam)

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/prritam)
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/murphyable)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pritamtheargumentativeyouth/)

Feel free to reach out to me ðŸ™‚
